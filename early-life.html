                <p><img class="inset" src="/imgs/babytrumo.jpg" alt="" />Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, the fourth of five children of Mary Anne MacLeod Trump and her husband, Frederick Christ Trump, Sr. Trump’s mother was born in Scotland and emigrated to the United States in 1930. His father was born in New York City, the son of German immigrants. During Trump’s childhood, the family lived an upscale community of the Queens Borough of New York City known as Jamaica Estates.

                    Fred Trump owned and operated a successful real estate company called Elizabeth Trump & Son, named after Fred Trump’s mother and himself, which developed properties for middle-class white families in Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. When they were old enough, the three Trump sons—Fred, Jr., Donald, and Robert—worked for the company in construction sites and offices. The Trumps’ daughters, Elizabeth and Maryanne, did not work for the family business. Donald and Robert Trump eventually became involved in their father’s business as adults. Their brother Fred became an airline pilot and died of alcoholism in 1981. Donald Trump cites his brother’s ultimately fatal battle with addiction as the reason he does not drink. Robert died in 2020 and Maryanne died in 2023.</p>
